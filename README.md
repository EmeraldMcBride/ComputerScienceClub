# ComputerScienceClub


This was a group project done at Okanagan College for the projects course. 
We created a web application for the college to use as a Computer Science Events hub for students and non-students. 
This application was written using the django python framework.
This page will be getting hosted very soon; when that time comes I will put the URL here so you can see the website live.
